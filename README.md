### NOTE

This installer has been developed for MY OWN use. You are free to fork it or use it but do it at YOUR OWN risk; I will not tailor this software to anyone but my own needs. I personally recommend that you learn how to install Arch Linux the manual way but if you want an easy Arch installation, check out [archfi](https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi), [LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS) or [james-d12's arch installer](https://github.com/james-d12/arch-installer). If you still wish to use KAI, proceed with the instructions.

Also, currently there is only a post-installation script to set up Arch how I like it to be. I plan on making an installation script as well.

### Instructions

As the actual installation script has not been made yet, there are currently no instructions.
